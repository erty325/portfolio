# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

A single-page personal portfolio site (Miguel Ángel Posada Marín, backend developer) built with Astro. No UI framework (React/Vue/etc.) is used — pages are plain `.astro` components. Site content and copy are in Spanish (`lang="es"`).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server at `localhost:4321`
- `npm run build` — runs `astro check` (type checking) then `astro build`; type errors fail the build
- `npm run preview` — serve the production build locally
- `npm run astro -- <cmd>` — run other Astro CLI commands (e.g. `astro add`)

There is no test suite and no separate lint command configured.

## Architecture

**Content/component separation.** All visible site copy (personal info, stack, experience, education, projects, nav links) lives in `src/data/profile.ts` as typed exports (`personal`, `stack`, `experience`, `education`, `languages`, `projects`, `nav`). Components import from this file rather than hardcoding text — keep it that way when editing content. The source of truth for this data is `docs/about-me.md` (a Spanish-language personal info doc); update both when personal/professional info changes.

**Page composition.** `src/pages/index.astro` is the only page. It wraps everything in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` and assembles section components in order: `Nav`, `Hero`, `About`, `Stack`, `Experience`, `Projects`, `Education`, `Contact`, `Footer`. Each section is a self-contained `.astro` component under `src/components/` with its own scoped `<style>` block — there's no shared component library beyond the CSS custom properties in global styles.

**Design tokens.** `src/styles/global.css` defines the full design system as CSS custom properties on `:root`: colors (`--bg`, `--ink`, `--accent`, `--line`, etc.), fonts (`--font-display` = Space Grotesk, `--font-body` = IBM Plex Sans, `--font-mono` = IBM Plex Mono), font-size scale (`--fs-2xs` … `--fs-3xl`), spacing, radii, and easing. The theme is dark-only (`color-scheme: dark`), styled as a "backend systems console" with an amber accent — reuse these tokens in new components instead of introducing new literal colors/sizes.

**Reveal-on-scroll.** Any element with class `.reveal` starts hidden/offset and is revealed via an `IntersectionObserver` set up in an inline script in `BaseLayout.astro`, which adds `.is-visible` on intersect. Falls back to fully visible when `IntersectionObserver` is unsupported or `prefers-reduced-motion` is set. New animated sections should follow this same `.reveal` pattern rather than inventing a new scroll-animation mechanism.

**Icons.** Brand icons come from the `simple-icons` package, referenced in `profile.ts` by export name (e.g. `icon: "siPython"`) and resolved dynamically in `Stack.astro`. Because some brand colors (near-black hexes) would be invisible on the dark background, `Stack.astro` computes relative luminance and falls back to `--ink-muted` when the brand color is too dark — reuse this pattern if icons are added elsewhere. Items without a matching brand icon use a short text `fallback` badge instead.

**Assets.** `src/assets/` holds images processed through `astro:assets` (`<Image />`, optimized/typed imports — see `Hero.astro`). `public/` holds files served as-is verbatim (favicon, `certificados/*.pdf` referenced directly by URL from `profile.ts`).

**TypeScript.** `tsconfig.json` extends `astro/tsconfigs/strict`. Since `npm run build` runs `astro check` first, keep `profile.ts` types (`StackItem`, `ExperienceEntry`, `EducationEntry`, `Project`, etc.) accurate when changing data shapes.
